# ADR-002: Event Sourcing Deferred to Phase 3

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-12-05  
**Deciders:** ARC SAGA Architecture Team  
**Context:** .cursorrules recommend CQRS with event sourcing, but Phase 2.4 prioritizes desktop-first simplicity.

## Decision

Event sourcing and CQRS architecture patterns are **planned but not critical** for Phase 2.4. Current implementation uses direct storage writes with event emission stubs for future integration.

## Rationale

1. **Phase 2.4 Scope**: Desktop-first deployment requires minimal infrastructure complexity. Event sourcing adds operational overhead (event store, projections, eventual consistency).
2. **Current Event Emission**: Core components already emit events (`orchestrator/events.py`), but persistence is deferred to Phase 3.
3. **Migration Path**: SQLite schema supports event table addition without breaking changes.
4. **Audit Requirements Met**: Current logging and correlation IDs provide sufficient observability for Phase 2.4.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Event type definitions exist (`orchestrator/events.py`)
- ✅ Event emission hooks in core components
- ⏸️ Event store persistence (deferred to Phase 3)
- ⏸️ Read model projections (deferred to Phase 3)
- ⏸️ Event replay/reconstruction (deferred to Phase 3)

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Faster Phase 2.4 delivery
- Reduced infrastructure complexity
- Sufficient observability via structured logging

**Negative:**

- No event replay capability in Phase 2.4
- No read model optimization
- Eventual consistency patterns deferred

**Mitigations:**

- Event types are forward-compatible with future event store
- Schema migration path documented
- Observability sufficient via correlation IDs and metrics

## Future Migration (Phase 3)

When scaling to multi-user or cloud deployment:

1. Add `events` table to SQLite (or migrate to PostgreSQL)
2. Implement `EventStore` protocol (append-only event persistence)
3. Build read model projections (materialized views)
4. Add event replay for audit/reconstruction
