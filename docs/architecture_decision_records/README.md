# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains architectural decisions made for the ARC SAGA project.

## Purpose

ADRs help Cursor AI understand WHY certain architectural patterns and technical decisions were made in the codebase. This context improves code generation quality and consistency.

## Format

Each ADR follows this template:

---
